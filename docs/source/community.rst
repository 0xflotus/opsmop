Community
=========

The purpose of the OpsMop community is to come together to build the ultimate configuration system we all want to use.
We love to hear use cases, stories, challenges, and ideas and learn from everyone's experiences.

Forum
=====

The official Opsmop discussion form is hosted `here <https://talk.vespene.io/c/opsmop-general>`.  The purpose of the forum
is to get help, ask questions, post ideas, coordinate development, and brainstorm features.  While this is a subforum
of the `Vespene <http://vespene.io>` forum and GitHub.

In respect of worldwide time zones and the nature of software development, there is no official realtime chat channel.

Also if you post to some other site like StackOverflow or Reddit, we are unlikely to see your posts.

What's The Deal About Vespene?
==============================

OpsMop does not require Vespene, and Vespene does not require OpsMop.
They were simply written by the same person and have similar design aesthetics reading minimalism and software design.

GitHub
======

OpsMop lives on GitHub `here <https://github.com/vespene-io/opsmop>`_.

Code contributions are very welcome! To submit a pull request to the master branch after reading :ref:`plugin_development`.
Often it may be best to discuss a development idea on the forum before contributing to avoid duplicate efforts.

Of course not all contributions are code.  We're also quite welcome to have documentation improvements.  The documentation
source lives in the 'docs/source' folder of the main repo.

We're also very appreciative of bug reports and helping other users with questions.

Bugs should also be filed directly in GitHub, but if you would like some help or want to discuss a bug more widely, the
forum is fine for that too.

We do *not* track feature requests in GitHub because it would be viewed as mean-spirited to close them and sometimes
opinions change.  Please feel free to talk about ideas on the forum, and start a new thread for any idea that you like.
