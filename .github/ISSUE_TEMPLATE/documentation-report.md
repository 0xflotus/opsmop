The documentation for docs.opsmop.io is generated from two places.

Most pages other than module documentation come from the "docs/source/*.rst" files in the main "opsmop" repository.

Module docs are generated from the "opsmop-demo/module_docs/*.py" files.

If you would like to update the docs feel free to send a pull request to either, or otherwise you can delete this text and mention what documentation problem you found instead.

Thank you!
