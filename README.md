Community and Contributions
===========================

The purpose of the Opsmop community is to come together to build the ultimate configuration tool we all want to use.

Contributions are greatly appreciated and will be open starting December 1st. Until then, we're moving things around and establishing a solid
baseline, as well as gathering your feedback and ideas.

Take a look at the development guide on the website for starters and feel free to browse around the code - there are some areas
that are still undergoing heavy refactoring.

If this project seems interesting to you, we highly recommend joining the OpsMop forum linked below.
